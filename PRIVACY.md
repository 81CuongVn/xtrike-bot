# Privacy Policy
Last updated: 2021 December 1

0. This is subject to change at any time. We'll notify you if it does thru our Discord server or other means.

1. This bot complies with the [Discord Developer ToS](https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal) and the general [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

2. The bot does not knowingly give its services to users that aren't legally allowed to use Discord, such if the user doesn't meet the minimum age requirement, so data stored may or may not include said individuals. (See number 5.)

3. All Discord data will only be accessible on Discord.

   For example, you won't be able to access a "sniped message" outside of Discord unless you invoke the `snipe` command in a Discord server.

4. We only track how many commands the bot has executed for our statistics. They are public and can be accessed via the `stats` command or using the `xtrike-bot.xyr11.repl.co/` endpoint. We don't track any other stuff.

5. For some of its features, the bot stores data which may be personally identifiable.

   List of data stored which may be personally identifiable:
   - "Author ID" or "User ID", the most prominently stored personal identifier which is used on all `sniper` commands[^1] and the `image` command
   - "Message attachments" and "Message timestamp"  for the `image` command
   - "Message content", "Message attachments", "Message embeds", "Message reactions", "Message timestamp", and "Message edited timestamp" for the `sniper` commands

6. We do not share or sell data to 3rd parties. We only use 3rd parties in the form of APIs so that we can satisfy the features of the bot.

   Privacy Policies of APIs used:

[^1]: Sniper commands are the `snipe`, `editsnipe`, and `reactionsnipe` commands.
