## Develop

### Prerequisites
+ [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
+ [Node.js 16.6 or later (preferably the latest version)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
+ [a MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/)
+ [an OCRSpace API key](https://ocr.space/ocrapi)
+ [Replit account (optional)](https://replit.com)

### Configure repository
1. *If you're using Replit*, click the big gray button: [![on Replit](https://replit.com/badge/github/xyr11/xtrike-bot)](https://replit.com/github/xyr11/xtrike-bot).

   *If not*, then clone the repository via Git
   ```
   cd "C:/Path/of/folder/you/want/this/repo/to/go"
   git clone https://github.com/xyr11/xtrike-bot.git && cd xtrike-bot && npm i
   ```

2. *If you're using Replit*, add the keys and values in the System Environmental Variables part, following the naming scheme of the keys below [(see the Replit docs for more info)](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/storing-sensitive-information-environment-variables).

   *If not*, then create a `.env` file, copy the stuff below and replace the values with the actual value
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-token
   CLIENT_ID=your-discord-client-id
   MONGO_URI=your-mongo-db-uri
   OCRSPACE_KEY=your-ocrspace-key
   # If you want to customize the timezone. Needs a valid TZ name (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
   TIMEZONE=Antarctica/South_Pole
   ```

3. On the `config.json` file, change the `exports.prefix`, `exports.botId`, `exports.botSupport`, `exports.devs`, `exports.botServer`, `exports.errLog`, and `exports.pingArea` variables to your own liking. Read the comments to see what they do.

### Run repository
*If you're on Replit*, you should press the big "Run" button.

*If not*, enter the following command:
```
npm start
```
If no errors are encountered, you will be able to see this message:
```
Ready as <Bot username>! (<Date and time>) ðŸ¤–
```

### Customizing the bot
You can add additional .env variables to customize the bot. See the documentation below.

<details>
<summary>Customize the presence details</summary>

```
STATUS=online          # online | idle | dnd | invisible
ACTIVITYTYPE=PLAYING   # PLAYING | WATCHING | LISTENING | COMPETING
PRESENCE=Bot is online
ISMOBILE=true          # If you want the "Online in mobile" status. Will ignore ACTIVITYTYPE.
```

</details>

### Updating local copy (for Git)
***NOTE: This will overwrite all files that you have modified, so you will lose them.** New files that you created will *not* be affected *unless* the latest commit has a file with the same filename in the same location.*

To update the code, enter the following:
```
git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/main && npm i
```
If you want your created files to be saved permanently then I suggest forking this on GitHub and do Steps 1-3, replacing the url of my repo to yours.
