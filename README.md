[![Status](https://img.shields.io/uptimerobot/status/m786499889-6b41061a49e587f762227724)](https://replit.com/@xyr11/xtrike-bot) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/xyr11/xtrike-bot)](#license) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com) [![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/xyr11/xtrike-bot)](https://github.com/xyr11/xtrike-bot/blob/main/package.json)

## Features
### Search for text in images!
Can't find that one image your friend sent that got buried by a day's worth of messages? Well, you can now search for them! Powered by [OCRSpace](https://ocr.space/) and [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/). (Enter `;image` for more info.)

### Extract the raw video from external links!
It's a real inconvenience when you need to open links just to watch epic fails or low quality memes. So now, the bot will automatically extract and send the video whenever someone sends a link! Powered by [youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/). (Supported sites: Twitter, Tiktok.)

### And more in the future!
Hang tight.

## Add the bot to your server
*The invite link will be available once the bot gets out of beta.*

## Develop

### Prerequisites
+ [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
+ [Node.js 16.6 or later (preferably the latest version)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
+ [a MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/)
+ [an OCRSpace API key](https://ocr.space/ocrapi)
+ [Replit account (optional)](https://replit.com)

### Configure repository
*If you're using Replit*, click: [![Run on Replit](https://replit.com/badge/github/xyr11/xtrike-bot)](https://replit.com/github/xyr11/xtrike-bot). *If not*, then clone the repository via Git by opening your console and entering the following command:
```
cd "C:/path/of/repo/folder"
git clone https://github.com/xyr11/xtrike-bot.git && cd xtrike-bot && npm i
```

After that, rename the `example-config.js` file to `config.js` and replace the values of all the required variables to configure your bot. There are comments to help you out.

### Run repository
*If you're on Replit*, press the big "**Run**" button. *If not*, open your console and enter the following command to start your bot:
```
npm start
```
If no errors are encountered, you should be able to see the following message:
```
Ready as <Bot username>! ðŸ¤– (<Date and time>)
```

### Customizing the bot
You can customize the bot by replacing the default value of the optional variables on your `config.js` file.

<details>
<summary>Documentation</summary>

Variable | Default value | Description
-- | -- | --
`botPrefix` | "`;`" | Prefix of the bot. You can do more than 1 symbol here BUT not a whole word. This will have no effect if the user used slash commands (if slash commands are already deployed).
`botSupport` | N/A | User IDs of people that has the 'Bot Support' role. Right now they don't do anything but in the future this may change
`timezone` | "`Etc/GMT`" | Timezone for console logging of time. Needs to be a valid TZ name, you can learn more about it on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
`errorLogging` | N/A | Channel ID for error logging. All errors caught will be send in the specified channel. Note that the error message may include personal info such as folder names.
`status` | "`online`" | Presence status: `online`/`idle`/`dnd`/`invisible`
`actType` | "`playing`" | Activity type: `playing`/`watching`/`listening`/`competing`
`actName` | "`;info`" | Activity name, the text that will show up in "Playing..."
`isMobile` | `false` | If you want to set the status to "Online in mobile device". If true, this will ignore `actType`

</details>

### Updating the cloned repository (for Git)
To update the code, enter:
```
git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/main && npm i
```
***NOTE: This will overwrite all files that you have modified, so you will lose them.*** If you want it to be saved permanently then I suggest forking the repository instead and doing `git merge` with your own version every time there is a new update.

## Roadmap
<details>
<summary>To-do's for future versions</summary>

- Dedicated `video` command for extracting videos on platforms `youtube-dl` supports
- Support for command aliases
