*(Previously known as "Alpha 0.1" to "Alpha 0.5")*

All Discord.js pre-v13 code.

## Develop

### Prerequisites
+ [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
+ [Node.js 16.6 or later (preferably the latest version)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
+ [a MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/)
+ [an OCRSpace API key](https://ocr.space/ocrapi)
+ [Replit account (optional)](https://replit.com)

### Configure repository
1. *If you're using Replit*, click the big gray button: [![on Replit](https://replit.com/badge/github/xyr11/xtrike-bot)](https://replit.com/github/xyr11/xtrike-bot). After that, go to the "Shell" tab and enter `npm test` to install Node 16.

   *If not*, then clone the repository via Git
   ```
   cd "C:/Path/of/folder/you/want/this/repo/to/go"
   git clone https://github.com/xyr11/xtrike-bot.git && cd xtrike-bot && npm i
   ```

2. *If you're using Replit*, add the keys and values in the System Environmental Variables part, following the naming scheme of the keys below [(see the Replit docs for more info)](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/storing-sensitive-information-environment-variables).

   *If not*, then create a `.env` file, copy the stuff below and replace the values with the actual value
   ```
   # If you want to customize the timezone that will be shown in logs then add a valid 'TZ database name' below (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
   TIMEZONE=Antarctica/South_Pole
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-token
   CLIENT_ID=your-discord-client-id
   MONGO_URI=your-mongo-db-uri
   OCRSPACE_KEY=your-ocrspace-key
   ```

### Run repository
*If you're on Replit*, press the big "Run" button. *If not*, enter the following:
```
npm start
```
If no errors are encountered, you will be able to see this message:
```
Ready as <Bot username>! (<Date and time>) ðŸ¤–
```

### Updating local copy (for Git)
[**NOTE: This will overwrite all files that are updated, so you will lose all changes.** Files you created, like for example `betterIndex.js`, will *not* be affected *unless* the latest commit has a `betterIndex.js` file in the same location.]

To update the code, enter the following:
```
git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/main && npm i
```
If you want your created files to be saved permanently then I suggest forking this on GitHub and do Steps 1-3, replacing the url of my repo to yours.
