## Features
### Search for text in images!
Can't find the image that your friend send? Well, you can now search for them by using words! Powered by [OCRSpace](https://ocr.space/) and [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/).

### Send a Twitter or TikTok link and the bot will extract the raw video!
It's a real inconvenience if someone sent an external link to a video. But now, it wouldn't be anymore! Powered by [youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/).

### And More In The Future!
Hang tight.

3. On the `config.json` file, add values to the `exports.botSupport`, and `exports.devs` variables. Read the comments to see what they do.

### Run repository
*If you're on Replit*, you should press the big "Run" button.

*If not*, enter the following command:
```
npm start
```
If no errors are encountered, you will be able to see this message if the bot successfully logs in to Discord:
```

### Customizing the bot

### Updating the cloned repository (for Git)
To update the code, enter:
```
git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/main && npm i
```
***NOTE: This will overwrite all files that you have modified, so you will lose them.*** If you want it to be saved permanently then I suggest forking the repository instead and doing `git merge` with your own version every time there is a new update.
