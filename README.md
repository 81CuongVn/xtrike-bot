A multi-purpose Discord bot written in [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) that does all sorts of bot stuff.

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/uptimerobot/status/m786499889-6b41061a49e587f762227724)](https://replit.com/@xyr11/xtrike-bot) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/xyr11/xtrike-bot)](#license) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com) [![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/xyr11/xtrike-bot)](https://github.com/xyr11/xtrike-bot/blob/main/package.json)

## Features
### Search for text in images!
Can't find that one image your friend sent that got buried by a day's worth of messages? Well, you can now search for them! Powered by [OCRSpace](https://ocr.space/) and [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/). (Enter `;image` for more info.)

### Extract the raw video from external links!
It's a real inconvenience when you need to open links just to watch epic fails or low quality memes. So now, the bot will automatically extract and send the video whenever someone sends a link! Powered by [youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/).[^1]

### And more in the future!
Hang tight.

## Add the bot to your server
*The invite link will be available once the bot gets out of beta.*

## Develop

### Prerequisites
+ [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
+ [Node.js 16.6 or later (preferably the latest version)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
+ [a MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/)
+ [an OCRSpace API key](https://ocr.space/ocrapi)
+ [Replit account](https://replit.com) (optional)
+ [Oxford Dictionaries API ID and key](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) (for the `oxford` command, optional)

### Configure repository
*If you're using Replit*, click: [![Run on Replit](https://replit.com/badge/github/xyr11/xtrike-bot)](https://replit.com/github/xyr11/xtrike-bot).

*If not*, then clone the repository via Git by opening your console and entering the following commands:
```
cd "C:/path/of/repo/folder"
git clone https://github.com/xyr11/xtrike-bot.git && cd xtrike-bot
npm i
```

### Set up the bot account
On https://discord.com/developers/applications, click "New Application". Add your application name and press "Create" to create a new application. You can set your bot description in this page.

After that, go to the "Bot" tab. Click the "Add Bot" button and press the confirmation button. After that, enable all privileged intents in the "Privileged Gateway Intents" tab so that the bot can properly fetch data. You can also set a custom bot name and bot avatar in this page.

### Add config variables
After that, rename the `example-config.js` file to `config.js` and replace the values of all the required variables to configure your bot. There are comments to help you out.

### Run repository
*If you're on Replit*, press the big "Run" button.

*If not*, open your console and enter the following command to start your bot:
```
npm start
```
If no errors are encountered, you should be able to see the following message:
```
Ready as <Bot username>! ðŸ¤– (<Date and time>)
```

### Customizing the bot
You can customize the bot by replacing the default value of the optional variables on your `config.js` file.

<details>
<summary>Documentation</summary>

Variable | Default value | Description
-- | -- | --
`botPrefix` | "`;`" | You can use more than 1 character here and any character except a space. This will have no effect if user used slash commands (if slash commands are deployed).
`botName` | "`Xtrike Bot`" | Name of the bot.
`botDescription` | "`Xtrike Bot is a multi-purpose bot.`" | Description of the bot. It can have multiple lines and Discord embed formatting.
`botColor` | "`#E3E5E8`" | Used for the color of embeds sent by the bot. Use a hex color value like "#RRGGBB".
`infoFields` | Check file | Info fields. This is an array of fields that will be shown in the `;info` embed. Fields needs a `name` and `value` property, and they support Discord embed formatting too.
`botSupport` | N/A | User IDs of people that has the 'Bot Support' role. Right now they don't do anything but in the future this may change.
`errorLogging` | N/A | Channel ID for error logging. All errors caught will be send in the specified channel. Note that the error message may include personal info such as folder names.
`status` | "`online`" | Presence status: `online`/`idle`/`dnd`/`invisible`.
`actType` | "`playing`" | Activity type: `playing`/`watching`/`listening`/`competing`.
`actName` | "`;info`" | Activity name, the text that will show up in "Playing..."
`isMobile` | `false` | If you want to set the status to "Online in mobile device". If true, this will ignore `actType`.

### Updating the cloned repository (for Git)
To update the code, enter:
```
git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/main && npm i
```
***NOTE: This will overwrite all files that you have modified, so you will lose them.*** If you want it to be saved permanently then I suggest forking the repository instead and doing `git merge` with your own version every time there is a new update.

## Roadmap
<details>
<summary>To-do's for future versions</summary>

- Command that temporarily disables other commands
- Use a unified class for commands
- Get the total number of messages the bot has sent
- Endpoint will cache results every 30 seconds instead of requesting data every time someone visits
- More probably...
